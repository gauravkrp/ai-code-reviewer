further improve the system by:
- Adding trend analysis to track code quality over time
- Implementing code suggestion capabilities rather than just review comments
- Adding automated fix proposals for common issues
- Creating a dashboard to visualize code quality metrics
- Integrating with code coverage tools to suggest areas for more testing
